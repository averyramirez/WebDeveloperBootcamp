Create an array of movie object. Each movie should have a title, rating and hasWatched properties. Iterate through the array and print out something that looks like:

You have watched "In Bruges" - 5 stars

var movies = [
	{
	title: "Texas Chainsaw Massacre",
	hasWatched: true,
	rating: 5
	},
	{
		title: "Frozen",
		hasWatched: false,
		rating: 4.5
	}
]

movies.forEach(function(movie){
    var result = "You have ";
    if(movie.hasWatched){
        result += "watched ";
    } else {
        result += "not seen ";
    }
    result += "\"" + movie.title + "\" - ";
    result += movie.rating + " stars";
    console.log(result)
})
